# Smart HVAC System

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a smart HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system that optimally regulates temperature and humidity within a building. The system integrates Arduino-based automation with various sensors and actuators to enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort.

## Features
- Automated temperature and humidity control
- Real-time monitoring using an LCD display
- Integration with DHT11 sensor for environmental data collection
- HVAC system response based on predefined setpoints
- Alarm system for extreme temperature or humidity levels
- Energy-efficient operation using Arduino-based automation

## Components Used
- **Arduino UNO** (1 unit)
- **DHT11 Sensor** (1 unit) - Measures temperature and humidity
- **Capacitive Touch Sensor** (1 unit)
- **Breadboard** (1 unit)
- **LEDs** (4 units)
- **Alphanumeric LCD Display** (1 unit)
- **Servo Motor** (1 unit)
- **Jumper Wires** (20 units)
- **Sliding Potentiometer** (2 units)
- **Rotary Potentiometer** (1 unit)
- **Resistors** (4 units)

## System Architecture
The system uses an **Arduino UNO** microcontroller as the core processing unit. The **DHT11 sensor** collects temperature and humidity data, which is displayed on an **LCD screen**. Based on user-set values and predefined thresholds, the HVAC system adjusts cooling levels using actuators. The alarm system triggers a buzzer when extreme environmental conditions are detected.

## Code Implementation
The project is programmed using **C++** and the **Arduino IDE**. The core functionalities include:

- Reading sensor data from the **DHT11**
- Mapping analog input values from **potentiometers** to set environmental thresholds
- Controlling **LEDs** and **servo motors** based on environmental readings
- Triggering an **alarm** if conditions exceed safe limits

## How to Use
1. **Setup the hardware**: Connect all components as per the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the code**: Use Arduino IDE to upload the provided source code.
3. **Monitor environmental parameters**: The LCD display will show real-time temperature and humidity readings.
4. **Adjust setpoints**: Use the potentiometers to modify temperature and humidity setpoints.
5. **Observe HVAC response**: The system will automatically regulate cooling and trigger alarms as needed.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **IoT** for remote monitoring and control
- Use of more **advanced sensors** for improved accuracy
- Implementation of **AI-driven predictive cooling models**
- Integration with **renewable energy sources** for enhanced sustainability
